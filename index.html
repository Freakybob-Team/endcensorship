        <h1>Fight KOSA (Kids Online Safety Act)</h1>
        <p>The Kids Online Safety Act is being reintroduced. This could prevent minors from accessing LGBTQ+ services
            such as gender affirming care, and could require age verification for users, which is a data-privacy nightmare.

        <h1>Stop The UK Safety Act of 2023</h1>
        <p>The UK Safety Act (UKSA, as I will refer to it) requires age verification on 18+ content. However, there is no definition
            on what is 18+. As such, even <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250731152544/https://support.spotify.com/uk/article/age-restricted-content-age-check/">services like Spotify</a>
            are implementing age verification. It also causes smaller companies to suffer, as ID and facial verification companies charge fees.
            These companies are also likely to store your data, which could lead to doxxing and other issues.

        <h1>Stop Payment Processers from Censoring Services</h1>
        <p>Payment processers, such as PayPal, Stripe, and MasterCard are being pressured to censor 18+ and LGBTQ+ content from a
            SWERF (Sex Worker Exclusionary Radical Feminist) and TERF (Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist) organzation.
            This resulted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/715299/itchio-games-delisting-payment-processor-paypal">
                Steam and itch.io removing NSFW games.
